# Hello there! 

My name is Michael and I'm a student trying to figure out reverse engineering, C/C++ programming, Rust, and more. I mainly dabble with a lot of low level stuff.
Like x86_64 assembly, rust, and C++. In fact, I've known C/C++ for at least 3 years now, I'm still learning with a lot of these things but yea. I'm a person
who's really into a lot of FOSS and Open source projects, as someone who uses a lot of open source projects for a lot of the things I work with, I find them
much better. I'm kinda young for a lot of these things, but I am somehow really good and understanding and learning these things. One of my biggest projects right now is the Open source project named [OculusLinkLinux](https://github.com/MilkJug1/OculusLinkLinux), a project that I have  been working on for 2 years almost.

Outside of programming I mainly focus on academics, sports, and weightlifting. I might actually in some of my more personal posts talk about my weightlifting journey through the years. This website actually has been based off of the old Jekyll base, so hopefully nothing is conflicted through the 2 new ones. The posts are a direct copy from Jekyll and imported them into Hugo, with some fixes when needed.
