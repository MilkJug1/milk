## Important note
So this was originally written in August of 2023, I am now coming back to this around Feb of 2024 with an entire different outlook on life, school, programming, and many more things. I will still keep this around, but I will also include my current reaction to things at certain parts.


## What happened? 
  Well, I'm finally back guys. As you guys currently see, at first I actually was going to make a video about this, but I then decided that I may not be able to do that. Since I kind of have to think about how I want to make a script now, since I think I may need to improve in that field. 
  At least, when considering my last couple of scripted videos. They aren't *that* bad, but I know I can do *MUCH* better.

  Now yes, I know you guys are already asking about the website. What happened? Why this theme? I can't cover all of those questions, but I can answer most.

  Why did I change the website for like the 5th time now? Well it's mainly because I'm trying to get a good look at this website, since I want to have something that looks nice and is easy to read, and also has a cool theme that I will personally like. Since this website is somewhat personal, at least in the programming field for me, this is a blog website so it's supposed to represent certain parts of me that I don't show on live streams or in recordings of myself.

  If you guys can remember from the past, I was originally using Jekyll for this, since it was natively supported by Github Pages, the main way I'm hosting this. And my past self, really hated Website Development, since I can sometimes find it very, very confusing, especially with all the different ways of actually hosting something like this. I mainly just wanted an easy way to host a website, and to create posts for blogging purposes.

  Now Jekyll is a fine project, it isn't that bad honestly. It's just that I had soo many issues with trying to do anything on that website, and I think that maybe due to the fact that I may have never really tried to understand Jekyll as a whole, even when reading the docs. I mean, I had so many issues, with post creation and theming and more. Right now it is very unstable to work with right now, since any small change will break the website. One of the reasons why I haven't been posting as much. Remember, theming was a big thing with me, and I wanted something that looked nice, but also was great for reading massive amounts of texts on any platform.

To be honest, Web Dev isn't my thing, I don't really like it, Programming wise(JS, TS, Ruby, Flutter, Dart, etc), and trying to figure stuff with HTML and CSS. Actually touching upon that statement, HTML and CSS aren't as bad as I once thought they were, just a bit more tedious. ~~Now that probably was due to the fact that I was using an editor that didn't have HTML and CSS support and plugins out of the box, at the time I think I was using a mix between Vim/Neovim, and VSCode(both MSCode, and Codium. I don't remember which one I was using at the time).~~ Scratch that, as VSCode has support for CSS and HTML out of the box, Neovim/Vim has minimal support out of the box, I just failed to correctly set that up. Using Vim/Neovim to edit HTML without any plugins and stuff to make your life easier, is hell. I did that for 2 months because at first, I was giving up on Jekyll and I was either going to make my own theme or make my own website from the ground up, as in theming wise and stuff.

Another thing that I was attempting was to incorprate Neovim and terminal applications into my workflow, as I have begun to start using them more often and I've started learning them. As I've wanted to learn Neovim for a while now, the only issue was vim motions and setting up a proper config. I was using a mix of Neovim, VSC, and markdown editors (Obisidan, Logseq, Simplenote, plus many others). Each had their own pros and cons, Logseq/Obsidian became a notetaking app that was helping me out in real life! Which I had never realized before. I was using Obisidan/Logseq to take notes(actually), design and mindmap things, and for quick brain dumps. I even started journaling in it, which was surpising at first not going to lie. Though, attempting to learn how to write in markdown and figuring all of the things behind, plus while using many different editors at once to get a blog post written was a bit tedious. It definitely caused me to stay away from blog posting since of how many times I had to switch back and forth. Now, that has changed.

As you currently see, I have given up on that endeavour, since I deemed it a bit too much out of me and; Well, trying to do that alongside making sure that I study for my classes and Academic stuff was hard. One good thing that came out of this was during my research, I think I may have done this after seeing another person's website and seeing a little piece of text saying that it was hosted with Hugo, another static site generator like Jekyll, led me to more static site generators like Jekyll. And much better and easier ones too, Hugo, which is the current generator for the website, I found to be *much* less problematic when creating posts, and even theming. Custom theming on Jekyll didn't work as well as you expected, I thought you would include a sites theme as a submodule of a website, but for Jekyll, No. You had to put the **source** of a theme directly into your root of the website, which is completely different from how Hugo does it. They make it easier by easier adding it as a module of a website, or cloning it into a `themes/` folder in the root of the website dir, and selecting the theme from there.

## Theming 
Now I'm still trying to find a good theme from this website, as I'm not sure what I want. At first, with certain pictures, I was going to do this one terminal theme:

> Note that this was before the creation of this blog post, depending on how it goes, this may or may not be the theme of the website that you are currently on.

## School Now (End of School :))
>That above section that you see above you right now is what I was thinking of school when I first went into it, currently as of writing this it is May 27th, 2023, and I'm officially a sophomore. Looking back at my previous texts and stuff that I wrote when I was about to go into school is funny, I had such a different view of High School and more, I can't say it was more naive but it is something different. Coming out of High School, to say that it was an experience is an understatement. It was a fucking adventure. Honestly, I did so much and became an entirely different person. From me being in basketball, whether being a manager towards the end of the season or playing during the beginning was a night and day differences, I got to experience things that changed my whole view of the world. I'm much happier now than what I was when I started this all, plus you might be able to tell the differences in writing here and before. I got to do so much, hell I even got to go to state with my English Superbowl team that ended up placing 4th in my entire damn state. I've changed so much now than what I was going into school.

^ A continuation off of the previous blog post.

Physically I've also changed, much more than what I originally thought, I'm taller now, I'm much more stocky-er, built a bit more too, and able to handle shit that my past self couldn't of.  There's also been a new development with me, that I don't really know how to explain. Since this being more of a website that talks about my projects, rather than my personal life.

To say it bluntly, this school year introduced me to a relationship that I never predicted, but I'm happy with. I actually really love it, though I'm not going to talk about it much here since this isn't the spot for it. Though to let you guys know, there will be references to her here and there, just by simple comments probably. I don't know.  My math part of me has gotten so much better, I passed Algebra 2 with a A, Geometry with also an A. In Academic Superbowl, there were things that covered Spherical Triangles. <- My current self right now in 2024 is laughing knowing what I just did. This part was written in the end of 2023 before my sophmore year so yeah.
Something that is kind of confusing, but once you get the hang of it and look at it. You'll be able to understand it. I actually made notes in Obsidian about those topics. As we were kind of forced to in our team. I studied the hell out of it and I even got a medal at the end of the year showing how hard I worked for it. Not only that, because of all of the time that I had to deal with school, which affected me programming since I had no time for it, I got to refresh my mind about programming and languages in general. I know much more about Rust now than I did before going into school this year, I *finally* got to understand some of my topics with programming languages that I've always had issues with.


It was a crazy school year, but I adapted to it. And finally figured out study habits that I've always had issues with. I got to know so many people, people who were either in my grade or way above it. From people in basketball to the older people in my Superbowl teams, somehow I got to be in many different groups both of entirely separate qualities, from the jocks/sports people, to the interesting band and orchestra people. I didn't go into it thinking that it would be bad, but I didn't think I would come out actually almost liking school. It was very fun and even though I struggled in some spots, I had a lot of fun.
It made me the happiest I've ever been in the past 5 years. Mainly because of the relationship that I'm in. I've also focused on trying to improve my physical self, which you guys might actually see in some of the posts here and there. Just some updates on how I'm doing in weights and if I have improved or not. By the way, I was not that strong going into that year, I think my PB for back squat was, I think 125, now it's 165 lbs, and I'm doing 125 lbs regularly. My stamina and my arms have changed so much since the beginning of this year. I did take photos of myself from back then and looking at me now its soo different. My writing has also seemed to improve much more. As you can see above, I was just starting to get into Honors English, now having an interesting style of writing was weird for my English class, though I managed and I had to do multiple essays and research papers that actually were somewhat good, the style of writing and more. Something I didn't think I would do so good on.
