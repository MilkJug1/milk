            Woah, its been a crazy couple months hasn&rsquo;t it, at least for this website. Now If you don&rsquo;t all ready see, this site has gone under some big changes, #1 is that the entire site has some form of a blog selection screen, bad thing is, it kind of looks ugly. This is going to be fixed soon, but since i&rsquo;m working on a new project(will be mentioned later on in here) it may be a while before it comes, also trying to find a theme that works good with how this is, and also just looks nice is kind of hard to find.

            What is this and What is it going to be used for
At the moment, I am still trying to figure it out, also what to use to really build this website. I really don&rsquo;t know HTML, JS, CSS (Tried it once before, didn&rsquo;t like it) I&rsquo;m hoping to build this in WASM since I know that. Yeah, like you saw at the start, this page has more stuff coming, please wait and stay tuned, i&rsquo;m working very hard for the next release.

            Well this is going to be a weird start, now that I am able to post blogs, its going to feel weird the first couple of days.
Some of you may not know who I am, if not then I guess you haven&rsquo;t taken a look at my Github main page. For all who don&rsquo;t know, I am a programmer (I think that&rsquo;s super obvious), been doing it for a couple of years and I taught my self.

            Well, Happy New Years everyone! When I was first writing this, it was a bit early, around the time New Years happened, this has gone under a ton of revisions and more.
Anyways, welcome back to the blog, and yes the website has been updated, at least a tiny bit, I tried my best to find the best thing that looked nice, at first I was starting to try and use all of the Premade Github Pages theme(since thats how this website is hosted) and after like 2 days, I decided to go a different route.

            WOW has it been a while, 7 months to be exact. Sorry about that, a lot of things got in my way, especially with the OLfL project, the open source project that I am trying to work on.
Some of you may be wondering where have I been these past couple of months, well its a long story, and I have a lot to talk about. Plus some new stuff about OLfL that not even the discord knows.
